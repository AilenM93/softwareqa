# SLDC - TESTING & QA

_This document is for ***educational purposes*** only. I've included a login validation scenario for a mobile banking app to keep the document simple, yet comprehensive._

   
## What is the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)?
SDLC is a process used to create software that meets the stakeholders' requirements cost-efficiently. It helps developers avoid rework by building software as per the client's needs and receiving constant feedback.

## Testing & The Software Development Lifecycle
The below RUP diagram created by IBM shows that Testing & QA is present throughout the entire SDLC:

### Phase 01: Planning
This phase focuses on understanding the needs, defining the project scope, and creating a solid execution plan.

| EXAMPLE OF TESTING & QA ROLES IN PLANNING |
|-------------------------------------------|
| Identifying Potential Risks |
| Defining Testability | 
| Providing Input on Feasibility |


This is an example of a project called ZippyBank, where I assessed the potential risks, challenges, and improvements of the login requirements and included them as comments. I created the template, but it can be adapted depending on the needs of the project/tester.

### Phase 02: Design
The design phase is like laying out the blueprints for a building. Here, the development team translates the requirements into a technical roadmap for the software. 

| EXAMPLE OF TESTING & QA ROLES IN DESIGN |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Reviewing UI mockups |
| Analyzing dataflow diagrams | 
| Participating in design reviews |

Here's an example dataflow datagram for the ZippyBank app:

And an example of feedback provided to help make the data flow more comprehensible and avoid bottlenecks for the developers:

### Phase 03: Development
This is where the code is written and the software is brought to life. Here, developers translate the blueprints created in the design phase into functional software.

| EXAMPLE OF TESTING & QA ROLES IN DEVELOPMENT |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Reviewing code |
| Test plan refinement | 
| Early usability testing collaboration |

The screenshot below is a sample of a test plan built for ZippyBank. Although the test plan is much more extensive, here will see just the Features to Be Tested, Features Not to Be Tested, Testing Approach, and Pass/Fail Criteria:

Keep in mind that this is just a sample, and I selected those features based on actual banking apps.
