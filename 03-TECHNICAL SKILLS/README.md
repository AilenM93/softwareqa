In this repository, we will cover the basics of:

### Hardware:

**Understanding of core components:** This helps testers understand how hardware limitations can impact software performance and identify potential bottlenecks during testing.

### Software:

**Operating Systems (Windows, macOS, Linux):** Testers need to be familiar with the target operating system(s) to ensure software behaves as expected across different environments.

**Software installation and configuration:** Understanding common installation processes and configuration options helps testers identify potential installation issues or software compatibility problems.

**Basic understanding of common software applications:** Testers may encounter bugs in various software types, so familiarity with basic functionalities is beneficial.

### Networking:

**Basic network concepts:** Testers often deal with web-based applications or software that interacts with networks. Understanding these concepts helps identify network-related bugs.

### Software Development Fundamentals:

**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Testers play a crucial role within the SDLC. Knowing the different phases helps them understand their place in the development process.

**Bug lifecycle:** How bugs are reported, tracked, and fixed - Testers are responsible for identifying and reporting bugs. Understanding the bug lifecycle ensures proper reporting and efficient resolution.

### Additional Skills:

**Basic programming concepts:** While testers don't necessarily need to be programmers, some basic understanding of programming logic can be helpful in analyzing bugs and communicating with developers.

**Database fundamentals:** Testers may encounter software that interacts with databases. Knowing some database concepts can be advantageous.

By understanding the systems they're testing, testers can design better tests, identify bugs more efficiently, and collaborate smoothly with developers to ensure high-quality software.
