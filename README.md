# Software QA Roadmap


### Basic Testing & QA Skills

**1. [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):](00-SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT-LIFE-CYCLE-SDLC)** planning, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance - and how testing fits into the entire SDLC.

**2. Test Case Design:** fundamentals of creating test cases that cover different functionalities and potential scenarios.

**3. Bug Reporting:** bugs documentation, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

**4. Technical Skills:** Basic computer literacy, familiarity with different operating systems (Windows, Mac, etc.), and learning new software.

### Intermediate Testing & QA Skills:

**1. Testing Techniques:** test case design, exploring various testing techniques like black-box testing, white-box testing, exploratory testing, etc.

**2. Test Management Tools:** Jira, Bugzilla, TestRail, and Postman to manage test cases, track bugs, and collaborate with developers.

**3. Agile Methodology:**  Agile principles and how testing fits within Agile frameworks (Scrum, Kanban) in modern software development.

**4. Domain Knowledge:** Testing in specific domains (e.g., finance, healthcare).

### Advanced Testing & QA Skills:

**1. Automation Testing:** Automating repetitive test cases with tools like Selenium and Cypress.

**2. API Testing:** testing APIs with different tools (e.g. Postman).

**3. Performance Testing:** Testing software performance under load to ensure smooth operation under real-world conditions with JMeter, LoadRunner, and Gatling.

**4. Security Testing:** Security concepts and testing software for vulnerabilities.

**5. SDLC Integration:** Advanced testers can contribute to the entire SDLC by participating in requirement reviews and design discussions, not just the testing phase.

**6. Communication & Collaboration:** Excellent communication and collaboration skills are key to working effectively with developers, project managers, and other stakeholders.

## Additionally:

**1. Analytical Thinking:** Analyzing software behavior, identifying potential issues, and critical thinking in software testing.

**2. Problem-Solving:** Troubleshooting and finding solutions to bugs and software defects.
